Made for myself, for security reason, only in command line

This password manager can :
- Add, edit and delete credentials
- Back up and erase passwords database
- Change login password
- Generate passwords
- Encrypt and decrypt passwords using AES-CBC with SHA256

Run ./app.py while having installed all dependencies in requirements.txt using pip install -r requirements.txt

WARNING : gui.py, encryption.py, database.py and passwords.json are for test and for a graphic user interface which is not available yet, only app.py is needed for now
